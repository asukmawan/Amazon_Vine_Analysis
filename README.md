# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

# Overview - Amazon Vine Program

The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.


There are approximately 50 datasets available, which contain reviews of a specific category of products. The watches dataset was chosen to perform a cloud ETL process using Google Colab Notebook.
Each one contains reviews of a specific product


You’ll need to pick one of these datasets and use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin

Next, you’ll use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.


# Results

Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

There is a bulleted list that addresses the three questions for unpaid and paid program reviews (7 pt)
